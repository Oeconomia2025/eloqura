- **Visual Consistency**: Matching badges and action buttons with theme-appropriate colors
- **Result**: Clear visual distinction between different DeFi position types

### Navigation System Enhancement
- **Issue Resolved**: Sidebar navigation was expanding unexpectedly when clicking navigation icons while in collapsed state
- **Solution Implemented**: Multi-layered state protection system with localStorage persistence and navigation state locking
- **Technical Details**: 
  - Added state locking mechanism during navigation using React refs

### Successful Netlify Deployment & Error Handling
- **Achievement**: Successfully deployed to https://oeconomia.io via Netlify with comprehensive error handling
- **Technical Implementation**: Enhanced React Query error handling with graceful API failure management
- **Error Handling**: App no longer crashes when backend APIs unavailable - shows appropriate "data unavailable" messages
- **Price Chart Enhancement**: Added informative messaging when live price data isn't accessible on static deployment
- **User Feedback**: "It's online! Thank you. It's almost perfect" - successful deployment confirmation
- **Result**: Fully functional static deployment with wallet connectivity and complete UI without crashes

### Light/Dark Mode Toggle Implementation
- **Issue**: Theme toggle button implemented but visual changes not applying despite JavaScript state changes
- **Status**: Theme classes being applied to document root correctly, but CSS variables not updating visually
- **User Feedback**: "It doesn't work still" - toggle not producing visible theme changes
- **Technical Details**: ThemeProvider working, toggle button functional, localStorage persistence working
- **Note**: Considered acceptable limitation per user acknowledgment that "it's okay" if too difficult

### Netlify Build Configuration Resolution (August 2025)
- **Issue Resolved**: Multiple deployment failures due to Vite configuration incompatibility with Netlify's build environment
- **Root Cause**: `import.meta.dirname` syntax and complex Vite config causing "Could not resolve entry module" errors
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Created `vite.config.netlify.ts` with simplified configuration using `__dirname`
  - Updated `netlify.toml` to use Netlify-specific build config
  - Removed server build from static deployment process
- **Technical Details**: Netlify environment doesn't support newer Node.js syntax, required backward-compatible approach
- **Result**: Build process now works reliably in Netlify's environment with proper path resolution

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
